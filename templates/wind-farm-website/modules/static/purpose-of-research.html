	</div>
	<div>
		Communities living near wind turbines have presented with a cluster of health symptoms sometimes called "Wind Turbine Syndrome".
		The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) have recently conducted a thorough review and did not find
		any scientifically robust studies that could definitively prove or disprove whether wind turbine noise causes human ill-health.
		Wind turbines generate noise that is below the audible range for humans (called infrasound) and nobody has yet conducted a scientific
		study in a laboratory to determine whether it has any effects on humans. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 72
		hours of wind turbine noise has effects on human health measures when compared to silence and to traffic noise.
